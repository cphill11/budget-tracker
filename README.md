# Budget Tracker Code

## Description

Budget tracker application that allows a user to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data /internect connection for users that are avid travelers.  This enables verification for the user as to the accuracy of personal financial accounts while travelling. 

When a user inputs an expense or deposit into the application, the user receives a notification that they have added an expense or deposit, despite the absence of an internet connection.

With restoration of intenet access, deposits or expenses added during offline periods are added to user's transaction history, and total financial records are updated.
